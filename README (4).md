# Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This Jupyter notebook analyzes sentiment data from a Twitter dataset using Python with Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Dataset

 The columns are initially unnamed and are later renamed to 'ID', 'Entity', 'Sentiments', and 'Remarks'.

## Data Exploration

### Basic Statistics
- Descriptive statistics of the dataset are obtained using `df_new.describe()`.
- Data types of each column are examined using `df_new.dtypes`.
- Missing values in the dataset are identified and handled with `df_new.dropna()`.

### Sentiment Distribution
- Sentiment counts are calculated and visualized using a pie chart to show the distribution of sentiments across different entities.
